         <p>
            Gardening is the practice of growing and cultivating plants as part of horticulture. In gardens, ornamental
            plants are often grown for their flowers, foliage, or overall appearance; useful plants, such as root
            vegetables, leaf vegetables, fruits, and herbs, are grown for consumption, for use as dyes, or for medicinal
            or cosmetic use.

            Gardening ranges in scale from fruit orchards, to long boulevard plantings with one or more different types
            of shrubs, trees, and herbaceous plants, to residential back gardens including lawns and foundation
            plantings, and to container gardens grown inside or outside. Gardening may be very specialized, with only
            one type of plant grown, or involve a variety of plants in mixed plantings. It involves an active
            participation in the growing of plants, and tends to be labor-intensive, which differentiates it from
            farming or forestry.
